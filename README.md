# Install requirements

* A relatively "modern" version of Perl (5.20+ recommended)
* PostgreSQL

## Installation

### 0. Install Perl & PostgreSQL (if you need them)

These days, I recommend using [plenv](https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv) to install a local version of Perl that doesn't muck with your system perl binary.

To do that, just:

`git clone git://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv.git ~/.plenv`

`echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.plenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`

`echo 'eval "$(plenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile`

`exec $SHELL -l`

`git clone git://github.com/tokuhirom/Perl-Build.git ~/.plenv/plugins/perl-build/`

`plenv install 5.20.0`

For PostgreSQL, if you're on an Apple product, you'll probably want to use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or the fancy, new [Postgre app](http://postgresapp.com/).

Once you've got those working, move on!

### 1. Get the source / sub-modules

First, fork the repository so that you have your own copy. Then:

`git clone git@github.com:yourusername/support.thetyee.ca.git`

`git checkout develop` (Always work on the `develop` branch while developing!)

`git submodule init && git submodule update` (this installs the `public` files)

### 2. Install the JavaScript dependencies

If you don't have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed, you'll need to do that first by installing [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Just download and install the package that's available for your operating system [from the Node website](http://nodejs.org/).

Then, to install [Bower, the JavaScript package manager](http://bower.io/), run:

`npm install bower -g`

Then, to install the project's JavaScript dependencies, run:

`bower install` inside of the `public` directory.

You should see output relating to Bootstrap, jQuery, and so on.

### 3. Install the Perl dependencies

From here, if you don't have a global install of [cpanm](https://github.com/miyagawa/cpanminus), you'll want to install that with the command `plenv install-cpanm` (this assumes that you installed Perl with `plenv` as described above).

Next, to localize the libraries that the project requires, you'll want to install [Carton](https://github.com/perl-carton/carton):

`cpanm install Carton`

Then install the project requirements into a local directory so that you know you're using the right ones:

`cd support.thetyee.ca`

`carton install`

At this point, you should probably go make a coffee or get a glass of wine or something, as it'll probably take a while to install all of the dependencies.

When that finishes, you should have a `local` directory full of libraries.

### 4. Get and edit the configuration files

Get them from the secret repository!

You'll need:
 
* app.development.json
* sqitch/sqitch.conf

You'll want to udpate the values in `app.development.json` and `sqitch/sqitch.conf` to point to your local PostgreSQL database.


### 5. Load the database schema with Sqitch

Next, you'll want to load the required table(s) into PostgreSQL using sqitch. You can do that like so:

`cd sqitch`
`sqitch deploy`

If that worked, you should see something like:

Deploying changes to db:pg:tyeedb_dev
  + schema ................ ok
  + transactions @v0.2.6 .. ok
  + transactions @v0.3.0 .. ok
  + transactions @v0.3.4 .. ok
  + transactions @v1.0.4 .. ok
  + transactions @v1.0.5 .. ok
  + transactions .......... ok

### 6. Start the development server

At this point you should have everything needed to start developing. Run the app in development mode with:

`carton exec morbo app.pl`

And, if everythign worked, you should see:

`Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000.`

### 7. Bask in the glory of local development!

Do NOT pass go. Do NOT collect $200. Just enjoy the moment. 

The development server will reload the app when any of the files are edited. So you can just edit the template files and the single-file application to your needs and refresh your browser to see the results. 

Errors will be written to your terminal, as well as shown in the browser.

### 8. Send a pull request with the changes

When you're done making changes, create a new pull request pointing from the branch that you're working on lcoally (probaby `develop`) pointing to the `develop` branch at https://github.com/phillipadsmith/support.thetyee.ca

Submit the pull request and congratulate yourself on a job well done. :)
