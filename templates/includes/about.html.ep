<p>We're an independent, online news magazine from BC. We're devoted to  fact-driven reporting and analysis that informs and enlivens our  democratic conversation. Our reporting has garnered numerous awards and the respect of our peers and readers. While some journalism gives the last word to power, we try to give the last word to ordinary folks.</p>

<p>In March and April 2015, Tyee Builders pitched in over $80,000 to expand our coverage of the upcoming federal election. The more we raise, the more we can do. Please join our community of over 3,000 Tyee Builders in making independent election coverage a reality.</p>
